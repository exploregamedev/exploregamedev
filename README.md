# ExploreGameDev

Hello, I'm a long time software developer, I've recently decided to get into game development.  I'm currently working with the Godot game engine.  

I've started to share some of my learings on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZIhKFkqPOMrdlpYBCxB8Fw) so check that out if your interested.
